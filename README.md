<h1>Book-Recommendation</h1>
<br>
<p>This project presents a Collaborative filtering-based Book Recommendation System using Python . It is built using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, with a focus on recommending books based on user preferences and historical rating data.It also shows Top high rated books based on Popularity based recommend system.</p>
<br>
<h3>Data Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Books: Book titles, authors, publishers, image URLs.</li>
  <li>Users: User IDs, locations, and age.</li>
  <li>Ratings: Ratings given by users to various books.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas, NumPy – for data wrangling and manipulation</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn – for similarity calculation (cosine similarity)</li>
  <li>Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization and insights</li>
  <li>Pickle - Used to load pre-trained machine learning/data objects</li>
  <li>Flask - A lightweight web framework for building the web application</li>
  <li>HTML , Bootstrap - used for building and styling the frontend user interface using Flask templates </li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial inspection, cleaning, and merging of datasets to create a unified view of user ratings.</li>
  <li>Popularity-Based Filtering: Identifies and recommends the most popular books with high average ratings and a maximum number of ratings.</li>
  <li>Collaborative Filtering (User-Item Matrix): Creates a pivot table of book titles vs. users with corresponding ratings to find similar reading patterns.</li>
  <li>Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between books to generate recommendations based on user preferences.</li>
  <li>Top N Recommendations: Given a book, the system returns the top N most similar books.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<h4>Successfully built a recommendation system capable of recommending similar books based on user input.</h4>
<h4>Demonstrated the use of both popularity-based and item-based collaborative filtering.</h4>
